## A flash loan protocol based on [Aave](https://aave.com/) and [Compound](https://compound.finance/).

# About

The ⚡️ThunderLoan⚡️ protocol is meant to do the following:

1. Give users a way to create flash loans
2. Give liquidity providers a way to earn money off their capital

Liquidity providers can `deposit` assets into `ThunderLoan` and be given `AssetTokens` in return. These `AssetTokens` gain interest over time depending on how often people take out flash loans!

What is a flash loan?

A flash loan is a loan that exists for exactly 1 transaction. A user can borrow any amount of assets from the protocol as long as they pay it back in the same transaction. If they don't pay it back, the transaction reverts and the loan is cancelled.

Users additionally have to pay a small fee to the protocol depending on how much money they borrow.

We are planning to upgrade from the current `ThunderLoan` contract to the `ThunderLoanUpgraded` contract. Please include this upgrade in scope of a security review.

## Roles

- Owner: The owner of the protocol who has the power to upgrade the implementation.
- Liquidity Provider: A user who deposits assets into the protocol to earn interest.
- User: A user who takes out flash loans from the protocol.
